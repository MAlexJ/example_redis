### Acknowledgment

In the context of Redis Streams, when we talk about acknowledging messages,
we typically refer to the acknowledgment process where consumers in a Consumer Group confirm
that they have successfully processed a message.

Redis tracks this acknowledgment to allow proper message distribution
and ensures that each message is processed at least once.

There are a few key concepts and types of acknowledgment that are used in Redis Streams:

1. XACK (Acknowledge)

   _Command_: **XACK**

   Description: The XACK command is used to acknowledge messages from a stream by a consumer in a consumer group.

   _How it works_:
   When a consumer in a consumer group successfully processes a message, it sends an XACK command to Redis.
   This command tells Redis that the consumer has finished processing the message and that it should be removed from the
   Pending Entries List (PEL) for that group.

   _Usage_:
   This ensures that the message will not be delivered again to any other consumer in the group.
   The message is considered processed and can be removed from the stream's pending list (if the group is done with it).

   _Example_: `XACK my-stream my-consumer-group message-id`

2. XPENDING (Pending Entries)

   Command: **XPENDING**
   
   Description: The XPENDING command is used to retrieve information about the pending messages in a consumer group.

   How it works:
   It does not acknowledge messages, but it gives you an overview of which messages are waiting to be processed and
   which consumers have not yet acknowledged them.
   You can use XPENDING to see pending messages in the group, including message IDs, the consumer that is currently
   waiting to process them, and the time they’ve been pending.

   Usage:
   This is typically used for monitoring the state of the consumer group and understanding which messages are still
   pending and which ones have not been acknowledged yet.

   Example: `XPENDING my-stream my-consumer-group`

3. XCLAIM (Claim Pending Messages)

   Command: **XCLAIM**

   Description: The XCLAIM command allows a consumer to claim a message that has been pending for too long without
   acknowledgment (i.e., the message is stuck in the Pending Entries List).

   How it works:
   If a consumer hasn’t acknowledged a message within a certain time frame (or if it crashed and didn’t acknowledge it),
   you can use XCLAIM to assign that message to another consumer in the group.
   This helps ensure that messages don't get stuck forever in the pending list and are eventually processed.

   Usage:
   You can set the idle time (the maximum time a message can stay unacknowledged) after which another consumer can claim
   it.

   Example: `XCLAIM my-stream my-consumer-group consumer-2 60000 minidle 5000 message-id`
   This would claim the message message-id for the consumer consumer-2 if it has been idle for more than 5 seconds.

#### Types of Acknowledgments in Redis Streams:

In the context of acknowledging messages, we primarily deal with two types of acknowledgments:

1. Explicit Acknowledgment (XACK)

    * The consumer explicitly acknowledges that it has processed the message.
    * The message is removed from the Pending Entries List (PEL).
    * This is the most common type of acknowledgment in Redis Streams for normal processing.

2. Implicit Acknowledgment (By Stream Design)

    * Redis doesn’t support an automatic or "implicit" acknowledgment by default.
      However, in a robust stream processing system, messages are implicitly acknowledged by a consumer when:
        - The consumer successfully processes a message.
        - The message is committed or logged in a database, meaning that it is assumed processed.

#### Key Considerations When Using Acknowledgments:

* Message Retention:
  Once a message is acknowledged (XACK), it is removed from the Pending Entries List (PEL). If no one acknowledges a
  message, it stays in the PEL, and other consumers can potentially pick it up using XCLAIM.

* Pending List and Consumer Monitoring:
  If a message is not acknowledged within a reasonable time frame, you can use commands like XPENDING to monitor the
  messages in the Pending Entries List (PEL), and potentially use XCLAIM to move unacknowledged messages to another
  consumer.

* At-Least-Once Delivery:
  Redis Streams deliver messages at least once to each consumer group.
  A message will be redelivered until it is acknowledged (with XACK).

* Message Expiry:
  Redis Streams themselves do not automatically delete unacknowledged messages.
  You should manage message expiration by setting appropriate TTLs on the stream
  or using Redis' stream trimming commands (e.g., XTRIM).

#### Example Flow:

- Consumer receives message from the stream.
- Consumer processes the message.
- If processing is successful, the consumer acknowledges the message using XACK.
- If the message fails processing, the consumer does not acknowledge it, and it remains in the Pending Entries List.
- Another consumer (or the same one, depending on configuration) may process the message later, using XCLAIM if it has
  been pending for too long.

#### To summarize:

1. XACK - Explicit acknowledgment. The message is removed from the Pending Entries List after processing.
2. XPENDING - Check pending messages in the consumer group.
3. XCLAIM - Claim unacknowledged messages from the Pending Entries List for reprocessing.
