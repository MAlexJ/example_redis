### Retry logic, DLQ, and re-consuming pending messages in Redis Streams using Spring.

#### 1. Retry Logic (on NACKs or Exceptions)

Goal:
Retry message processing if something fails (e.g., exception thrown, network error, etc.).

Redis Streams way:

- Redis doesn't have a built-in "retry count," but you can simulate retry logic like this:
- Don't ack the message on failure.
- Message stays in the Pending Entries List (PEL).
- Periodically read unacked messages from the PEL and try again.

Spring Boot strategy:

In your listener:

```
try {
    // Process message
    redisTemplate.opsForStream().acknowledge(STREAM_KEY, GROUP, message.getId());
} catch (Exception e) {
    // Don't ack here → stays in PEL for retry
    log.error("Processing failed, will retry later", e);
}
```

#### 2. DLQ (Dead Letter Queue)

Goal:
Move messages to a separate "dead-letter stream" if they fail too many times.

How it works:

- Redis tracks how many times a message was delivered.
- Use XPENDING to find messages stuck in PEL and how many times they've been delivered.
- If the delivery count is > threshold (e.g., 5), move it to a DLQ stream.

Example:

```
// Pseudocode
XPENDING mystream my-group
→ Get list of pending messages with count

If delivery count > 5:
XADD mystream.DLQ ... // move to DLQ
XACK mystream my-group <message-id> // acknowledge original
```

You can automate this with a scheduled job.

#### 3. Re-consumption of Pending Messages

Goal:

Recover messages stuck in the Pending Entries List (PEL) — maybe a crashed consumer left them unprocessed.

Strategy:

- Use XPENDING to find pending messages.
- Use XCLAIM to reassign them to a live consumer (if necessary).
- Reprocess them like normal messages.

Spring Boot way (manual):

```
List<PendingMessage> pending = redisTemplate.opsForStream()
                      .pending(STREAM_KEY, GROUP, Range.unbounded(), 10);

for (PendingMessage msg : pending) {
  // Optionally use XCLAIM to take ownership
  // Then read and process message again
}
```

Or, you can poll for PEL messages in a retry worker thread or a scheduled task.
